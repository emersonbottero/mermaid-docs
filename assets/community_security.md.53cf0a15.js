We regularly update Mermaid, and these updates may fix security defects discovered in previous versions. Check the Mermaid release notes for security-related updates.</p><p>Keep your application\u2019s dependencies up to date. Make sure you upgrade your package dependencies to keep the dependencies up to date. Avoid pinning to specific versions for your dependencies and, if you do, make sure you check periodically to see if your dependencies have had security updates, and update the pin accordingly.</p><h2 id="configuring-dompurify" tabindex="-1">Configuring DomPurify <a class="header-anchor" href="#configuring-dompurify" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>By default Mermaid uses a baseline <a href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DOMPurify</a> config. It is possible to override the options passed to DOMPurify by adding a <code>dompurifyConfig</code> key to the Mermaid options. This could potentially break the output of Mermaid so use this with caution.</p>',12),s=[o];function n(u,c,d,p,l,h){return t(),i("div",null,s)}const m=e(a,[["render",n]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
